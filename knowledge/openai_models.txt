OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models are large language models capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

Key Capabilities:
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Code generation and explanation
- Translation between languages
- Summarization and content creation
- Question answering based on context
- Function/tool calling for structured interactions

OpenAI API Models:
- GPT-4 Turbo: Most capable model with 128K context window
- GPT-4: High intelligence for complex tasks
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: Fast and efficient for most tasks
- Embeddings models: For semantic search and similarity

Function/Tool Calling:
OpenAI models support structured function calling, allowing them to:
1. Decide when to call a function based on user input
2. Generate properly formatted function arguments
3. Process function results and incorporate them into responses

This enables building agents that can:
- Search databases or knowledge bases
- Perform calculations
- Call external APIs
- Execute custom business logic

Example tool definition:
```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "search_knowledge",
        "description": "Search the knowledge base",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "query": {"type": "string"}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Best Practices:
- Use system messages to set behavior
- Maintain conversation history for context
- Handle rate limits and errors gracefully
- Validate and sanitize function call results
