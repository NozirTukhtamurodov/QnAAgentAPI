FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

Key Features:
- Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go
- Fast to code: Increase development speed by 200-300%
- Fewer bugs: Reduce human-induced errors by about 40%
- Intuitive: Great editor support with auto-completion
- Easy to use and learn with automatic interactive API documentation
- Standards-based: Based on OpenAPI and JSON Schema

FastAPI leverages:
- Starlette for the web parts
- Pydantic for the data validation using Python type hints
- ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) for async support

Basic FastAPI example:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

FastAPI automatically generates:
- Interactive API docs (Swagger UI) at /docs
- Alternative API docs (ReDoc) at /redoc
- OpenAPI schema at /openapi.json

FastAPI supports dependency injection, background tasks, WebSockets, and much more out of the box.
