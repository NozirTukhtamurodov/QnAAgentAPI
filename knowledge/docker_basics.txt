Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

Key Docker Concepts:

1. **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers. Built from a Dockerfile.

2. **Containers**: Runnable instances of images. Isolated from other containers and the host system.

3. **Dockerfile**: Text file with instructions to build a Docker image.

4. **Docker Hub**: Public registry for sharing Docker images.

5. **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications using YAML files.

Benefits of Docker:
- Consistency across environments (dev, test, prod)
- Rapid deployment and scaling
- Efficient resource utilization
- Isolation and security
- Portability across different platforms
- Version control for infrastructure

Common Docker commands:
- `docker build`: Build an image from Dockerfile
- `docker run`: Create and start a container
- `docker ps`: List running containers
- `docker stop`: Stop a running container
- `docker pull`: Download an image from registry
- `docker push`: Upload an image to registry

Multi-stage builds help create smaller, more efficient Docker images by separating build dependencies from runtime dependencies.
