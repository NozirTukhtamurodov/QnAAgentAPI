Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 

Key features of Python:
- Easy to learn and use with clear, readable syntax
- Dynamically typed with automatic memory management
- Extensive standard library (batteries included)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Support for multiple programming paradigms (OOP, functional, procedural)
- Large ecosystem of third-party packages via PyPI
- Popular for web development, data science, AI/ML, automation, and scripting

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. The name comes from the British comedy group Monty Python.

Common Python frameworks:
- Django and Flask for web development
- NumPy and Pandas for data analysis
- TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning
- FastAPI for building APIs
- Pytest for testing

Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces or keywords.
