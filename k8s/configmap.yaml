    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum.
    Released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity.
    
    Key Features:
    - Easy to learn and use with clear, readable syntax
    - Dynamically typed - no need to declare variable types
    - Automatic memory management with garbage collection
    - Extensive standard library ("batteries included")
    - Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Supports multiple programming paradigms (OOP, functional, procedural)
    - Large ecosystem of third-party packages (PyPI)
    
    Common frameworks and libraries:
    - Django, Flask - Web frameworks
    - NumPy, Pandas - Data analysis
    - TensorFlow, PyTorch - Machine learning
    - FastAPI - Modern API framework
    - Pytest - Testing framework

    FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
    
    Key Features:
    - Fast performance comparable to NodeJS and Go
    - Increases development speed by 200-300%
    - Reduces bugs by 40% with type hints and validation
    - Intuitive and easy to use with great editor support
    - Automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI, ReDoc)
    - Standards-based: OpenAPI and JSON Schema
    
    Built on:
    - Starlette for web parts
    - Pydantic for data validation
    
    Example:
    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    @app.get("/")
    async def root():
        return {"message": "Hello World"}
    ```
    
    Features include: dependency injection, background tasks, WebSockets, and more.

    Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
    
    Key Concepts:
    - Containers: Lightweight, isolated environments for applications
    - Images: Templates for creating containers
    - Dockerfile: Instructions for building images
    - Docker Hub: Registry for sharing images
    
    Benefits:
    - Consistent environments across development, testing, and production
    - Isolation of applications and dependencies
    - Efficient resource utilization
    - Easy scaling and deployment
    - Microservices architecture support
    
    Common commands:
    - docker build: Create image from Dockerfile
    - docker run: Create and start container
    - docker ps: List running containers
    - docker compose: Manage multi-container applications
